## AI Tool Usage

This project partially used **OpenAI ChatGPT**.

- **How it was used**:  
  ChatGPT was used to help create the **HTML layout and styling** for the ATM dashboard.

  - Front-end interface (HTML structure and form layout)
  - Basic UI styling and element arrangement for the dashboard

All business logic, controller logic, model definitions, and backend structure were implemented manually.
